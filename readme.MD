**WIP**

Simple keylogger for demo environments.

This will show you what key was pressed on a line by line basis but not the application that pressed it. This will be phase two.

## Requirements
`keyboard==0.13.5`

## Installing

Create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

`python keylogger.py`

It will start recording everything you type line by line.

To exit out of the script press the `esc` key at any time.
